HeaderFileReader
=====================

This is python utility which provides iterator for reading a text file
with headers.

It provides a iterator for reading files like /header_file_reader/test-data/movies.dat
which has header in the first-line and data in the subsequent lines. All of the fields 
in the file are separated by delimiter ('::' in the example file) and has a qualifier
("'" in the example file).

This is just a get your hands dirty in git-hub project.
